# Lewis A. Day

Software Engineer, with a MSc in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Exeter, and I hold a BSc in Mathematics from the same.

I have previously worked in C++, C, Python, MATLAB, C#, HTML+CSS, and numerous dabblings in other languages along the way.

Most of my repos are from recruitment take-home exercises with some personal projects thrown in for my own experimentation, typically to toy with different approaches e.g. Functional vs OOP, and different rendering APIs, e.g. SDL vs OpenGL vs Vulkan etc.
