# Lewis A. Day

Recent MSc Advanced Computer Science graduate from the University of Exeter, and I hold a 2:1 BSc in Mathematics from the same.

I have previously worked in C, C++, Python, MATLAB, C#, and, HTML+CSS.

My masters project, LewisADay/aegisk, was the delevopment of a selective killing mechanism for integration with asynchronous Bayesian optimisation methods. Following review the subsequent report shall be added to that repository, so far the indications are that the results are promising but not groundbreaking.
