# Lewis A. Day

Software Engineer, with a MSc in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Exeter, and I hold a BSc in Mathematics from the same.

I have previously worked in C, C++, Python, MATLAB, C#, and, HTML+CSS.

For 13 months I worked as a Software Engineer 1 at Imagination Technologies in their Validation Engineering department, where we ensured their products (CPUs & GPUs) were up to stratch. My day to day work involved writing and maintaining primarily GPU tests in C++ using OpenGL, OpenGL ES, and, Vulkan. Additionally, I was assisting with the development of a new testing framework within the organisation, chiefly I had been working on a procedure, and supporting applications, for automatically (or at least with very minimal developer interaction) generating useful human readable documentation using LaTeX. Much of this work was conducted in C#, with Avalonia 11 serving as the front end.

My masters project, LewisADay/aegisk, was the delevopment of a selective killing mechanism for integration with asynchronous Bayesian optimisation methods. Ultimately the conclusion of that research was that the expected gains didn't materialize in the final test suite, and after some additional post-masters research by one of the contributing academics it seems like a dead end for research. Nonetheless, null results are important, so I shall leave it up.
